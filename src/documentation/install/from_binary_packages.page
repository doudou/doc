title: Using Binary Packages

Rock's software is available as prebuilt binary packages for the following
operating systems:

 - [Ubuntu](#ubuntu) 12.04 and 13.04 on x86 and x86_64

=== Using Ubuntu Packages

In order to install the Ubuntu packages, you will have to add the source entry.
It will track the 'stable' flavor of Rock. In order to get the packages for next
and/or master, replace 'stable' by 'next' or 'master' in the URL.

For 12.04:

~~~
wget http://rock-robotics.org/stable/documentation/install/ubuntu-12.04.list
cp cp ubuntu-12.04.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d
~~~

For 13.04

~~~
wget http://rock-robotics.org/stable/documentation/install/ubuntu-13.04.list
cp cp ubuntu-13.04.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d
~~~

Then, run

~~~
sudo apt-get update
~~~

The packages can be used in two ways:

 - if you wish to use binary packages for all software that is packaged, install
   either the rock-osdeps or the osdeps package for the package set you wish to
   select (e.g. rock-toolchain-osdeps would pick binary packages for rock.base
   and rock.toolchain).
 - if you wish to use binary packages only for a few packages, install them
   separately. The naming scheme is rock-packagename, e.g. rock-tools-syskit for
   tools/syskit
