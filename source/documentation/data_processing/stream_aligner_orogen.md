To make life easier while using the stream aligner, an oroGen plug-in was
created. Using this plugin, the laser filter that we outlined in the previous
pages would be declared with:

~~~ ruby
task_context "Task" do
  input_port "lidar_samples", "/base/samples/LaserScan"
  input_port "transformation", "/base/samples/RigidBodyState"
  output_port "filtered_samples", "/base/samples/LaserScan"

  stream_aligner do
    max_latency 0.5
    align_port "lidar_samples", 0
    align_port "transformation", 0
  end
end
~~~

The usage of this plugin requires the drivers/orogen/aggregator package. The
project's manifest.xml must therefore contain:

~~~ xml
<depend package="drivers/orogen/aggregator" />
~~~

The following statements are available in the task context definition:

stream_aligner
: The stream_aligner statement will add a instance of the stream aligner to the
  task base class. If needed, this instance of aggregator::StreamAligner (from
  [the drivers/aggregator package]({% pkg drivers/aggregator %})) can be accessed
  from the C++ code as the _stream_aligner attribute.

max_latency(timeout_in_seconds)
: The max_latency statement sets the timeout of the stream aligner. It can be
  overriden through a generated aggregator_max_latency property on the task.

align_port(name, period)
: Registers a stream on the task's stream aligner, and pushes all the data that
  arrives on the specified port to this stream. The provided period is the
  _default period_ for the stream. It can be overriden at runtime by setting a
  generated property called "port_name"_period (e.g. lidar_samples_period for
  the lidar_samples stream)

In the C++ task, for each stream declared with align_port, a C++ callback
method, of the form "void stream_nameCallback(timestamp, sample)" is generated.

~~~ cpp
void lidar_samplesCallback(base::Time const& timestamp,
    base::samples::LaserScan const& sample)
{
  // process the sample
}
~~~

As usual with oroGen, if you add or remove streams after the first code
generation, you must update the files in tasks/ yourself, using if needed the
templates generated in templates/tasks/

Your task implementation MUST call TaskBase::configureHook() and
TaskBase::updateHook() if you reimplement the hooks. The hook code generated by
default by oroGen does this already.

The next page will now deal on the usage, at runtime, of a component that is
using the stream aligner as well as its online and offline monitoring.
