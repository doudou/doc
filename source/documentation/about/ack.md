If you are using Rock and present the work you've done using it, we would be
glad if you could acknowledge the project. In general, the citation would be:

<pre>
Rock: The Robot Construction Kit (http://rock-robotics.org)
</pre>

It is better to cite this website's URL as well as the project name.

Latex users can also use [this bibtex entry](rock.bib)
